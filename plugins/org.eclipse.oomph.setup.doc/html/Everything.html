<p>
 Consider the steps involved in setting up a fresh Eclipse development environment to work with the source code of a particular version of a specific project:
 <ul>
 <li>
 Install a project-specific IDE with appropriate tooling,
 i.e., an IDE configured with all the settings and tools needed for editing, compiling, debugging, and testing the project's artifacts.
 </li>
 <li>
 Materialize the workspace with the project's bundles and features by importing their workspace projects from various source code repositories,
 organizing those workspace projects into meaningful working sets.
 </li>
 <li>
 Materialize the target platform to contain all the bundles and features needed to compile the project's source code, run the project's tests, and exercise the project's end-user functionality.
 </li>
 </ul>

 The instructions for all these steps must be well-documented and generally evolve from release to release.
 As such, one should consider the following salient questions:
 <ul>
 <li>
 Who writes and maintains these instructions?
 </li>
 <li>
 How do contributors find these instructions for each specific project?
 </li>
 <li>
 How many contributors must follow these instructions, how often, and with how much invested time?
 </li>
 </ul>
 The most fundamental question is, why is anyone doing this manually?
 The overall process is tedious, error-prone, and time consuming,
 i.e., it's a complete waste of human resource.
 With Oomph, all these instructions are formalized as setup <a href="Everything.html#Task" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">tasks</a> that are <a href="Everything.html#TaskExecution" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">performed</a> automatically.
 </p>
 <p>
 In addition to the project-specific setup process,
 each user typically has her own personal favorite tools she wants installed
 as well as has her own personal preferences,
 such as key bindings,
 she wants uniformly applied to each installation and workspace.
 With Oomph Setup, this too is formalized and automated.
 </p>

 <p>
 The process of setting up a development environment involves two phases.
 The first, or bootstrap phase, involves installing a functional product on disk.
 Using the traditional manual approach one achieves this goal by as follows:
 <ul>
 <li>
 Download a product, i.e., a package, from Eclipse's download page.
 </li>
 <li>
 Unzip that download to the desired location on disk using an unzip tool that can handle Eclipse's zip files.
 </li>
 <li>
 Ensure that a bit-appropriate JRE version is installed and visible on the execution path.
 </li>
 <li>
 Run the executable.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
 The second phase involves activities performed in the running product itself:
 <ul>
 <li>
 Install additional tools not included in the downloaded product.
 </li>
 <li>
 Configure various preferences appropriately, ideally by importing those preferences from a carefully-crafted Eclipse preference file.
 </li>
 <li>
 Import workspace projects, ideally by importing those projects from a carefully-crafted project set file.
 </li>
 <li>
 Activate the required target platform, ideally by activating a carefully-crafted target platform description file.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
 To automate this setup process, Oomph provides the following:
 <ul>
 <li>
 An <a href="Everything.html#InstallerWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">installer wizard</a> that automates the both phases of setting up a development environment.
 </li>
 <li>
 A <a href="Everything.html#ProjectWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project wizard</a> that automates the second phase of setting up a development environment.
 <li>
 An <a href="Everything.html#ProjectWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">execution wizard</a> that automates updating the development environment,
 including the provisioning of personal favorite tools and personal preferences.
 </li>
 </ul>
 Oomph helps ensure that each developer works with the same uniformly-provisioned development environment
 and that each user has her personal tools and preferences uniformly available across all installations and workspaces.
 Note that Oomph can be installed into an existing IDE, i.e., one not installed by Oomph,
 via Oomph's <a rel="nofollow" href="http://download.eclipse.org/oomph/updates">update site</a>
 or via Oomph's <a rel="nofollow" href="http://download.eclipse.org/oomph/updates/org.eclipse.oomph.site.zip">site archive</a>.</p>
 </p>
 <p>
 To understand how best to exploit Oomph in order to save time and spare aggravation,
 some basic concepts need to be well understood.
 Automation is achieved by specifying setup <a href="Everything.html#Task" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">tasks</a> organized into <a href="Everything.html#Scope" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">scopes</a> stored in <a href="Everything.html#SetupResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">resources</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 An important footnote is that Oomph makes heavy use of <a href="Everything.html#BundlePool" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">bundle pooling</a>
 so it highly disk-space efficient to install many products and provision many target platforms
 because they can all share a common bundle pool such that for each installable unit, there is only on jar file on disk.
 Not only is this space efficient,
 it also dramatically improves installation and provisioning performance
 because once an installable unit is in the pool,
 it never again needs to be downloaded from the Internet.

<h2><a name="Task"></a>1&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasks</h2>
<p>
 A setup <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>task</code></a> is the fine-grained unit of work in the overall setup process.
 A task is declarative in nature,
 i.e., it describes what needs to be achieved rather than how it's achieved.
 Each task is contained within a <a href="Everything.html#Scope" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">scope</a>.
 The overall setup process involves <a href="Everything.html#TaskComposition" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">gathering</a> tasks from various scopes
 and then <a href="Everything.html#TaskExecution" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">performing</a> those tasks.
 </p>

<a name="Task.properties">
<p>
 Each task has the following properties:
 <ul>

<a name="Task.id">
<li>
 An optional <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#getID()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>ID</code></a> attribute.
 The value of this attribute,
 if present,
 must be unique within the containing <a href="Everything.html#SetupResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">resource</a>.
 If the task has an ID,
 a <a href="Everything.html#Variable" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">variable</a> is inferred for each populated String-typed attribute of that task.
 This variable behaves as if it were logically contained just before the task in the task's container.
 </li>

<a name="Task.excludedTriggers">
<p>
 An <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#getExcludedTriggers()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>excluded</code></a> <a href="Everything.html#Trigger" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">triggers</a> attribute
 that specifies the triggers for which that task is not applicable.
 This affects which tasks will be <a href="Everything.html#TaskComposition" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">gathered</a>.
 Most task implementations exclude the bootstrap trigger
 because they must execute within a running product where the task implementation along with the supporting infrastructure are installed.
 As such, task implementations hard-code the <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#getValidTriggers()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>permissible</code></a> triggers
 and task authors can further exclude triggers from those that are permissible.
 In the end,
 by logical exclusion,
 this induces an overall set of <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#getTriggers()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>allowed</code></a> triggers.
 </li>

<a name="Task.disabled">
<li>
 A <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#isDisabled()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>disabled</code></a> attribute that specifies whether or not the task should be gathered.
 </li>

<a name="Task.restrictions">
<li>
 An optional <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#getRestrictions()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>restrictions</code></a> reference
 that specifies the set of <a href="Everything.html#Scope" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">scopes</a> to which the task inclusively applies.
 TODO
 </li>

<a name="Task.order">
<li>
 Both a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#getPredecessors()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>predecessors</code></a> references and a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#getSuccessors()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>successors</code></a> reference,
 that specify that tasks that must be performed, respectively, before or after, the task itself is performed.
 Furthermore, a task has an intrinsic <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#getPriority()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>priority</code></a> that is determined by the task implementor.
 All these properties affect the <a href="Everything.html#Reorder" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">order</a> in which tasks are performed.
 </li>

<a name="Task.operations">
</ul>
 <p>
 Each task supports the following operations:
 <ul>

<a name="Task.performance">
<li>
 Logic for determining whether the task <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#isNeeded(org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTaskContext)" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>needs</code></a> to perform
 as well the logic for <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#perform(org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTaskContext)" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>performing</code></a> the task.
 The determination of whether that the task needs to perform
 is influenced by the <a href="Everything.html#Trigger" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">trigger</a>,
 i.e.,
 it affects how detailed will be the analysis for determining whether the task needs to be performed
 with the general goal being to <a href="Everything.html#TaskExecution" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">perform</a> only those tasks strictly needed for the <a href="Everything.html#Trigger.startup" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">startup</a> trigger.
 This behavior is documented on a per-task basis.
 </li>

<a name="Task.override">
<li>
 A task, in general, can be <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#overrideFor(org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask)" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>overridden</code></a> by other tasks during the process of <a href="Everything.html#TaskComposition" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">gathering</a> tasks.
 Which tasks are overridden by which other tasks,
 and how that override merges two tasks into a single combined task
 is specific to each task implementation and is therefore documented on a per-task basis.
 A task implement supports overrides by yielding a so called <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#getOverrideToken()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>override token</code></a>.
 Two tasks that yield equal override tokens are merged during the <a href="Everything.html#InitialPhase" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">initial</a> task gathering phase.
 </li>

<a name="Task.consolidate">
<li>
 A task, in general, can be <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTask.html#consolidate()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTask"><code>consolidated</code></a>.
 At the end of the task gathering phase,
 each task is <a href="Everything.html#Consolidation" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">consolidated</a> to optimize its representation in preparation before the task is <a href="Everything.html#TaskExecution" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">performed</a>.
 </li>

<h3><a name="Trigger"></a>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Trigger</h3>


<a name="Trigger.introduction">

<h2><a name="Scope"></a>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Scopes</h2>
<p>
 A <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Scope.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>scope</code></a> is the course-grained unit for grouping related <a href="Everything.html#Task" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">tasks</a>.
 Scope are hierarchically structured and tasks are <a href="Everything.html#TaskComposition" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">gathered</a> from them based on this hierarchical structure.

<a name="Scope.properties">
Scopes
 <p>
 Each scope has the following properties:

<a name="Scope.name">
<li>
 A required <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Scope.html#getName()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.Scope"><code>attribute</code></a>
 which should be a lower case name,
 i.e., like a single component of a qualified Java package name.
 The hierarchical <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Scope.html#getParentScope()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.Scope"><code>containment</code></a> structure of scopes
 induces a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Scope.html#getQualifiedName()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.Scope"><code>qualified</code></a> name attribute,
 based on the '.' separated names of the scopes,
 hence the recommendation to use a lower case scope name.

<h3><a name="ProductCatalog"></a>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Catalogs</h3>
<p>
 A <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/ProductCatalog.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>product catalog</code></a> is a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/ProductCatalog.html#getProducts()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.ProductCatalog"><code>container</code></a> for <a href="Everything.html#Product" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">products</a>

<a name="ProductCatalog.example">
For example,
 there is an Eclipse product catalog

<h3><a name="ProjectCatalog"></a>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Catalogs</h3>
<p>
 A <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Project.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>project catalog</code></a> is a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/ProjectContainer.html#getProjects()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.ProjectContainer"><code>container</code></a> for <a href="Everything.html#Project" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">projects</a>
 as well as a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTaskContainer.html#getSetupTasks()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTaskContainer"><code>container</code></a> for both
 the tasks to provision a workspace with any of those projects
 and the tasks to install the tools needed to work with any of those projects.
 For example,
 there is an Eclipse project catalog for provisioning various projects hosted at Eclipse.org.
 It is stored in a <a href="Everything.html#ProjectCatalogResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project catalog resource</a>.
 </p>

<h4><a name="Project"></a>2.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Projects</h4>
<p>
 A <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Project.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>project</code></a> is a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTaskContainer.html#getSetupTasks()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTaskContainer"><code>container</code></a> for <a href="Everything.html#Stream" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">streams</a>
 as well as a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTaskContainer.html#getSetupTasks()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTaskContainer"><code>container</code></a> for both
 the tasks to provision a workspace with any of those streams
 and the tasks to install the tools needed to work with any of those streams.
 For example,
 there is a project in the Eclipse project catalog for provisioning the Oomph project itself.
 Projects can optionally {contain nested projects.
 It is stored in a <a href="Everything.html#ProjectResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project resource</a>.
 </p>

<a name="Project.nested">
Projects can optionally contain <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/ProjectContainer.html#getProjects()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.ProjectContainer"><code>nested</code></a> projects
 which may be stored in a separate <a href="Everything.html#ProjectResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project resource</a> or in the same resource as the <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Project.html#getParentProject()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.Project"><code>containing</code></a> project.
 </p>

<h5><a name="Stream"></a>2.2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Streams</h5>
<p>
 A <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Stream.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>stream</code></a> is a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTaskContainer.html#getSetupTasks()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTaskContainer"><code>container</code></a> for both
 the tasks to provision a workspace with for that particular stream
 and the tasks to install the tools needed to work with that particular stream.
 For example,
 there is a stream in the Oomph project in the Eclipse project catalog
 for provisioning the source code of the Git <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/oomph/org.eclipse.oomph.git/">master</a> branch of the Oomph project.

<h3><a name="Installation"></a>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Installations</h3>
<p>
 An <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Installation.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>installation</code></a> is a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTaskContainer.html#getSetupTasks()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTaskContainer"><code>container</code></a> for the tasks to provision a specific installed Eclipse product.
 Its primary function,
 however,
 is that it specifies a reference to a product <a href="Everything.html#Version" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">version</a>.
 The tasks <a href="Everything.html#TaskComposition" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">gathered</a> for that product version are <a href="Everything.html#TaskExecution" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">performed</a> to that installed product.
 The <a href="Everything.html#InstallerWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">installer wizard</a> creates an instance based on the selected product version on the <a href="Everything.html#ProductPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">product page</a>.
 Even if the product installation hasn't been installed by Oomph,
 when Oomph is present,
 an installation instance is automatically created
 to refer to the synthetic <a href="Everything.html#Version.self" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">self</a> product version.
 </p>

<h3><a name="Workspace"></a>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Workspaces</h3>
<p>
 A <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Workspace.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>workspace</code></a> is a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTaskContainer.html#getSetupTasks()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTaskContainer"><code>container</code></a> for the tasks to provision a specific Eclipse workspace.
 Its primary function is that it specifies zero or more references to project <a href="Everything.html#Stream" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">streams</a>.
 The tasks <a href="Everything.html#TaskComposition" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">gathered</a> for each of those project streams are <a href="Everything.html#TaskExecution" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">performed</a> for that workspace
 as well as for the installed product used to open that workspace.
 The <a href="Everything.html#InstallerWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">installer wizard</a> creates an instance based on the selected project streams on the <a href="Everything.html#ProjectPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project page</a>.

<p>
 A <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/User.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>user</code></a> is a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/SetupTaskContainer.html#getSetupTasks()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.SetupTaskContainer"><code>container</code></a> for the tasks to provision
 every installed Eclipse product and every opened workspace ever used by the end-user.
 It provides an opportunity to customize all aspects of a user's experience with all their Eclipse products and workspaces.
 It also provides support for the following:
 <ul>
 <li>
 Recording the <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/User.html#getAcceptedLicenses()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.User"><code>accepted license</code></a> of each of the tools automatically installed tools,
 i.e., once a license is accepted,
 it can be recorded to avoid any future prompts involving that particular license.
 </li>
 Recording the <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/User.html#getUnsignedPolicy()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.User"><code>policy</code></a> with regard to handling of unsigned content,
 i.e., once unsigned content is accepted,
 that acceptance can be recorded to avoid any future prompts involving unsigned content.
 </li>
 <li>
 Recording configuration options, so called <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/User.html#getAttributeRules()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.User"><code>attribute rules</code></a>,
 that tailor where and how repositories, workspaces, and installations are physically stored.
 </li>
 </ul>

<h2><a name="Infrastructure"></a>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
 In addition to <a href="Everything.html#Scope" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">scopes</a> there are several other important structural elements for organizing and maintaining setup information.
 </p>

<h3><a name="Index"></a>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Index</h3>
<p>
 An <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Index.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>index</code></a> is a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Index.html#getProductCatalogs()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.Index"><code>container</code></a> for <a href="Everything.html#ProductCatalog" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">product catalogs</a>
 as well as a <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Index.html#getProjectCatalogs()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.Index"><code>container</code></a> for <a href="Everything.html#ProductCatalog" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project catalogs</a>.
 It also <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Index.html#getDiscoverablePackages()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.Index"><code>provides access</code></a> to all task models.
 All available <a href="Everything.html#Product" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">products</a> and <a href="Everything.html#Project" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">projects</a> are reachable from the index.
 All the <a href="Everything.html#SetupWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">setup wizards</a> are driven by this information.
 The index also <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Index.html#getDiscoverablePackages()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.Index"><code>maintains references</code></a> to dynamic Ecore models that provide additional <a href="Everything.html#Task" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">task</a> implementations.
 It is stored in the <a href="Everything.html#InstallationResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">installation resource</a>.
 </p>

<h3><a name="LocationCatalog"></a>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Location Catalog</h3>
<p>
 A <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/LocationCatalog.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>location catalog</code></a> maintains an index of all <a href="Everything.html#Installation" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">installations</a> and <a href="Everything.html#Workspace" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">workspaces</a>
 installed and provisioned by Oomph,
 including any installation where Oomph is installed,
 and any workspace opened by any installation with Oomph installed.
 It maintains a two-way map,
 i.e., for each installation, the workspaces it has opened are <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/LocationCatalog.html#getInstallations()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.LocationCatalog"><code>recorded</code></a>
 and for each workspace, the installations that have opened it are <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/LocationCatalog.html#getWorkspaces()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.LocationCatalog"><code>recorded</code></a>.
 Each time a product with Oomph installed is started,
 its installation-workspace pair is added to the maps.
 The installation-to-workspace map is ordered,
 so the most recently installed or started installation is moved to the front
 and its workspace is moved to the front of the list associated with that installation.
 Similarly, the workspace-to-installation map is ordered,
 so the most recently provisioned or opened workspace is moved to the front
 and the installation that opened it is moved to the front of the list associated with that workspace.
 It is stored in the <a href="Everything.html#LocationResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">location resource</a>.
 </p>

<h3><a name="CatalogSelection"></a>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Catalog Selection</h3>
<p>
 A <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/CatalogSelection.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>catalog selection</code></a> maintains an installation and provisioning history for the <a href="Everything.html#SetupWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">setup wizards</a>.
 It maintains the following:
 <ul>
 <li>
 The <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/CatalogSelection.html#getProductCatalogs()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.CatalogSelection"><code>selected subset</code></a> of the <a href="Everything.html#Index" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">index</a>'s available <a href="Everything.html#ProductCatalog" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">product catalogs</a> displayed in the <a href="Everything.html#ProductPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">product page</a>.

 </li>
 <li>
 The <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/CatalogSelection.html#getProjectCatalogs()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.CatalogSelection"><code>selected subset</code></a> of the <a href="Everything.html#Index" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">index</a>'s available <a href="Everything.html#ProjectCatalog" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project catalogs</a> displayed in the <a href="Everything.html#ProjectPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project page</a>.

 </li>
 </li>
 The <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/CatalogSelection.html#getSelectedStreams()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.CatalogSelection"><code>most recently selected</code></a> <a href="Everything.html#Stream" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">streams</a> chosen by the <a href="Everything.html#ProjectPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project  page</a>.
 </li>
 </ul>
 In other words, it maintains a persistent initial state for all the <a href="Everything.html#SetupWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">setup wizards</a>.
 It is stored in the <a href="Everything.html#CatalogSelectionResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">catalog selection resource</a>.
 </p>

<h2><a name="SetupResource"></a>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup Resources</h2>
<p>
 All the information for managing the automated installation and provisioning is maintained in resources.
 Because Oomph is modeled using <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/emf">EMF</a>,
 these resources are stored in XMI format.
 </p>

<h3><a name="IndexResource"></a>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Index</h3>
<p>
 The <code><a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/oomph/org.eclipse.oomph.git/plain/setups/org.eclipse.setup">index:/org.eclipse.setup</a></code> resource maintains the <a href="Everything.html#Index" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">index</a>,
 where <code>index:/</code> is redirected to <code>http://git.eclipse.org/c/oomph/org.eclipse.oomph.git/plain/setups/</code>.
 It generally consists of references to <a href="Everything.html#ProductCatalogResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">product catalog</a> resources and <a href="Everything.html#ProjectCatalogResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project catalog</a> resources.
 </p>

<h4><a name="ProductCatalogResource"></a>4.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Catalogs</h4>
<p>
 A product catalog resource maintains a <a href="Everything.html#ProductCatalog" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">product catalog</a>.
 For example,
 the <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/oomph/org.eclipse.oomph.git/plain/setups/org.eclipse.products.setup">Eclipse Products Catalog</a> resource
 contains all the products available at Eclipse,
 i.e., the equivalents of downloading and installing Eclipse packages.
 Each product catalog resource is generally assumed to contain a <a href="Everything.html#ProductCatalog.self" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">self</a> product catalog
 so that any product with Oomph installed, but not installed by Oomph,
 will behave consistently as if it where installed by Oomph,
 in particular,
 a <a href="Everything.html#InstallationResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">installation resource</a> will be demand created to refer to the <a href="Everything.html#Version.self" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">self</a> <a href="Everything.html#Version" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">product version</a>.
 The logical URI for this resource is <code>catalog:/self-product-catalog.setup</code>.
 It does not correspond to any physical artifact located in the file system.
 </p>

<h4><a name="ProjectCatalogResource"></a>4.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Catalogs</h4>
<p>
 A project catalog resource maintains a <a href="Everything.html#ProjectCatalog" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project catalog</a>.
 It generally contains references to various separately-maintained <a href="Everything.html#ProjectResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project resources</a>.
 For example,
 the <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/oomph/org.eclipse.oomph.git/plain/setups/org.eclipse.projects.setup">Eclipse Projects Catalog</a> resource
 references all the Oomph-enabled Eclipse projects
 and the <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/oomph/org.eclipse.oomph.git/plain/setups/com.github.projects.setup">Github Projects Catalog</a> resource
 references all the Oomph-enabled Github projects.
 Each project catalog resource is generally assumed to maintain a so called &lt;User> project resource.
 For example,
 the Eclipse Projects Catalog contains a reference to <code>user:/org.eclipse.projects.setup</code>
 where <code>user:/</code> is redirected to <code>~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.oomph.setup/setups/</code>.
 Projects can be added to or removed from this resource using the <a href="Everything.html#ProjectPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project page</a>.
 This feature allows a developer to author her own setup project and to logically add it to an existing read-only project catalog without modifying that project catalog.
 </p>

<h5><a name="ProjectResource"></a>4.1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Resources</h5>
<p>
 A project resource maintains a <a href="Everything.html#Project" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project</a>.
 Project resources are generally hosted on the Internet or on the local file system.
 For example
 the <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/oomph/org.eclipse.oomph.git/plain/setups/Oomph.setup">Oomph.setup</a> resource
 contains the <a href="Everything.html#Stream" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">streams</a> and <a href="Everything.html#Task" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">tasks</a> for the Oomph project itself.
 </p>

<h3><a name="LocationResource"></a>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Location Catalog</h3>
<p>
 The location resource maintains the <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/LocationCatalog.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>location catalog</code></a>.
 The logical URI for this resource is <code>user:/locations.setup</code>
 where <code>user:/</code> is redirected to <code>~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.oomph.setup/setups/</code>.
 </p>

<h3><a name="CatalogSelectionResource"></a>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Catalog Selection</h3>
<p>
 The catalog selection resource maintains the <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/CatalogSelection.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>catalog selection</code></a>.
 The logical URI for this resource is <code>user:/catalogs.setup</code>
 where <code>user:/</code> is redirected to <code>~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.oomph.setup/setups/</code>.
 </p>

<h3><a name="InstallationResource"></a>4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation</h3>
<p>
 An installation resource maintains an <a href="Everything.html#Installation" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">installation</a>.
 The physical URI of this resource is <code>org.eclipse.oomph.setup/installation.setup</code>
 relatively within the <code>configuration</code> folder of the installed product.
 </p>

<h3><a name="WorkspaceResource"></a>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Workspace</h3>
<p>
 An workspace resource maintains a <a href="Everything.html#Workspace" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">workspace</a>.
 The physical URI of this resource is <code>.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.oomph.setup/workspace.setup</code>
 relatively within the running product's phyiscal <code>workspace</code> folder.
 </p>

<h3><a name="UserResource"></a>4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;User</h3>
<p>
 The user resource maintain the <a href="Everything.html#User" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">user</a>.
 The logical URI for this resource is <code>user:/user.setup</code>
 where <code>user:/</code> is redirected to <code>~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.oomph.setup/setups/</code>.
 </p>

<h2><a name="BundlePool"></a>5&nbsp;&nbsp;Bundle Pools</h2>
<p>
 Eclipse's p2 technology supports the concept of a <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Getting_Started#Bundle_pooling">bundle pool</a>.
 Bundle pools help to dramatically reduce disk footprint
 and to eliminate repeated downloads of the same bundles and features,
 thereby dramatically improving the performance of software updates and target platform provisioning.
 Oomph makes heavy use of this technology for both its <a href="Everything.html#P2" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">p2</a> tasks and it <a href="Everything.html#Targlet" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">targlet</a> tasks.
 Further,
 Oomph provides a technology layer on top of p2
 to improve the behavior and performance of caching
 allowing Oomph to provide offline support for installing and updating installations and target platforms.
 </p>

<h2><a name="TaskComposition"></a>6&nbsp;&nbsp;Task Composition</h2>
<p>
 The installation and provisioning process is driven by gathering a <a href="Everything.html#Task" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">task</a> list from the available <a href="Everything.html#Scope" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">scopes</a>
 in preparation for <a href="Everything.html#TaskExecution" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">task execution</a>.
 </p>

<h3><a name="ScopeList"></a>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Scope List</h3>
<p>
 In preparation for gathering a task list,
 an ordered list of <a href="Everything.html#Scope" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">scopes</a> is collected.

<a name="ScopeList.scopeList">
The following process of collecting scopes is repeated once for each <a href="Everything.html#Stream" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">stream</a>
 specified in the <a href="Everything.html#ProjectPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project page</a> or in the <a href="Everything.html#Workspace" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">workspace</a>:
 <ul>

 <li>
 Visit the <a href="Everything.html#Version" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">product version</a>
 as selected in the <a href="Everything.html#ProductPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">product page</a> or in the <a href="Everything.html#Installation" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">installation</a>.
 <ul>
 <li>
 Add that product version's containing <a href="Everything.html#Product" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">products</a>'s containing <a href="Everything.html#ProductCatalog" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">product catalog</a> to the list.
 Add that product version's containing product to the list.
 Add that product version itself to the list.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 Visit a <a href="Everything.html#Stream" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">stream</a>
 as selected in the <a href="Everything.html#ProjectPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project page</a> or in the <a href="Everything.html#Workspace" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">workspace</a>, if there is one.
 <ul>
 <li>
 Add that stream's containing <a href="Everything.html#Project" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">projects</a>'s containing <a href="Everything.html#ProjectCatalog" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project catalog</a> to the list.
 Add that stream's outer-most containing project to the list
 and proceed down through the nested projects up to the stream's directly containing project,
 adding each project to the list along the way.
 Add that stream itself to the list.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>

 <li>
 Add the <a href="Everything.html#Installation" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">installation</a> to the list.
 </li>

 <li>
 Add the <a href="Everything.html#Workspace" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">workspace</a> to the list.
 </li>

 <li>
 Add the <a href="Everything.html#User" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">user</a> to the list.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </p>

<a name="ScopeList.scopeVariables">
<p>
 For each list of scopes, an ordered list of tasks is collected.
 Initially, for each scope in the list,
 three <a href="Everything.html#Variable" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">variables</a> are induced,
 one each for the <a href="Everything.html#Scope.name" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">name</a>, <a href="Everything.html#Scope.label" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">label</a>, and <a href="Everything.html#Scope.description" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">description</a>
 attributes of the scope
 where the variable name is prefixed with the <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/ScopeType.html" title="Class in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>scope type</code></a> as follows:
 <ul>
 <li>
 <code>scope.product.catalog</code>
 </li>
 <li>
  <code>scope.product</code>
 </li>
 <li>
  <code>scope.product.version</code>
 </li>
 <li>
 <code>scope.project.catalog</code>
 </li>
 <li>
 <code>scope.project</code>
 </li>
 <li>
 <code>scope.project.stream</code>
 </li>
 <li>
 <code>scope.installation</code>
 </li>
 <li>
 <code>scope.workspace</code>
 </li>
 <li>
  <code>scope.user</code>
 </li>
 </ul>
 The value of each such variable will be the value of that attribute for the scope.
 If the scope's label is <code>null</code>, the name is used as the label value
 and if the scope's description is <code>null</code>, the scope's label is used as the description value.
 In addition, to the <code>name</code> variable,
 for each product, product version, project, and project stream
 an additional variable with the name suffix <code>.qualifier</code> is induced
 where the value is the <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/Scope.html#getQualifiedName()" title="Method in org.eclipse.oomph.setup.Scope"><code>qualified name</code></a> of the scope.
 For example,
 the value of the <code>scope.project.stream.name.qualified</code> variable of the Oomph.setup project's master stream
 is <code>org.eclipse.oomph.master</code>
 All these induced variables are added, in scope order, to the initial gathered list of tasks.
 </p>

<a name="ScopeList.footer">
<p>
 Additional tasks are gathered into the task list from the ordered scopes by visiting each contained task of each scope as follows:
 <ul>
 <li>
 If the task is disabled,
 ignore the task.
 </li>
 <li>
 If the list of scopes doesn't contain all of the task's restrictions,
 ignore the task.
 </li>
 <li>
 If the task is <a href="Everything.html#Compound" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">compound</a>,
 recursively visit each of that compound task's contained tasks.
 </li>
 <li>
 Otherwise,
 add the task to the list of tasks.
 In other works,
 the gathered task list will only contain leaf tasks.
 </li>
 </ul>
 At the end of scope processing,
 the gathered task list contains
 all of the per-stream tasks,
 or just task list if there is no stream.
 Each task list (or the one task list) is further processed in two phases.
 The initial phase is applied for each task list separately.
 The per-stream task lists are then concatenated into a single list and the second phase is applied to that final composed list,
 or the one task list is further processed by the second phase.
 The processing of the the task list in each phase is roughly same.
 </p>

<h3><a name="TaskList"></a>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Task List</h3>
<p>
 The task list is processed to induce additional tasks,
 to <a href="Everything.html#Task.override" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">override and merge</a> tasks,
 to evaluate and expand variables
 and to <a href="Everything.html#Task.order" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">reorder</a> tasks.
 The members of the task list that are <a href="Everything.html#Variable" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">variables</a> induce an initial set of keys,
 i.e., a set of all variable names.
 Oomph tasks are modeled with EMF,
 so each task instance knows it corresponding EMF class.
 During the initial phase processing,
 the list of tasks is analyzed to determine the set of EMF classes that are required to implement all the tasks in the list.
 Each EMF class is processed as follows:
 <ul>
 <li>
 If the class contains enablement annotations,
 induce <a href="Everything.html#P2" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">p2 tasks</a>,
 i.e., tasks to install the necessary implementations in the installed product,
 and add these induced tasks to the head of the task list.
 </li>
 <li>
 If the class contains variable annotations,
 induce the <a href="Everything.html#Variable" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">variables</a>
 and add them to the head of the task list.
 </li>

 <li>
 Visit each attribute of the class as follows:
 <ul>
 If the attribute's type isn't String,
 ignore it.
 <li>
 If the attribute has both a variable annotation and a variable rule annotation,
 visit each instance of that attribute's class in the task list as follows:
 <ul>
 <li>
 If the attribute's value in that instance task is not empty,
 the rule isn't needed,
 so ignore it.
 </li>
 <li>
 If the instance task doesn't have an ID,
 or it does,
 but the key composed from the ID value, with '.' and the attribute name appended,
 is already in the list of induced keys,
 the rule isn't needed,
 so ignore it.
 </li>
 <li>
 Induce a rule variable for that attribute,
 if that rule variable hasn't already been induced for another task instance.
 </li>
 </ul>
 A mapping from rule variables to their inducing attribute is maintained.
 <li>
 </li>
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>
 At the end of this processing for the first phase,
 the list of tasks includes additional induced variables and tasks.
 For the final phase,
 the composed list of tasks contains no variables, because they've all been evaluated and expanded,
 and the induced tasks are already present.
 </p>

<a name="TaskList.substitutions">
<p>
 Further processing proceeds as follows:
 <ul>
 <li>
 Build a substitution map,
 i.e., task-to-task map of substitutions by visiting each task as follows:
 <ul>
 <li>
 Put the task's <a href="Everything.html#Task.override" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">override token</a> into an token-to-task map,
 and if another task for that token is already present in the token-to-task map,
 the visited task is a substitution for that other task so add that to the substitution map.
 As such,
 tasks later in the list can override tasks earlier in the list.
 </li>
 The substitution map is then further processed to follow the substitution mappings so as to represent the direct substitutions.
 </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>
 </p>

<h4><a name="InitialPhase"></a>6.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial Phase</h4>
<p>
 For the initial phase processing,
 all the tasks are efficiently copied,
 including the copying of the containing scopes.
 The copying process takes the task-to-task <a href="Everything.html#TaskList.substitutions" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">substitution</a> map into account,
 i.e., each task is logically replaced in the copy by its <a href="Everything.html#Task.override" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">merged override</a>.
 As such,
 only the final overridden merged task remains in the resulting task list copy
 and all references to the overridden and overriding tasks will reference the final merged override instead.
 Further processing of the task list proceeds with this copied task list.
 </p>
 <p>
 An explicit key map,
 i.e., a map from variable name to variable,
 is computed by visiting each variable in the task list.
 Note that the preceding copying process will have eliminated duplicate variables.
 The initial phase processing then proceeds by visiting each task with a non-empty ID attribute as follows:
 <ul>
 <li>
 Visit each attribute of the task's EMF class
 with respect to the variable name induced by appending '.' and the attribute name to the value of the task's ID attribute:
 <ul>
 <li>
 If the attribute is the ID attribute of a task,
 or the attribute isn't a single-valued String-typed attribute,
 ignore it.
 </li>
 <li>
 If the explicit keys contains the induced variable's name,
 the task's value for the attribute is empty,
 and the attribute has a variable annotation,
 change the task's value for the attribute to be a reference to the explicit variable.
 </li>
 <li>
 If the explicit keys do not include the induced variable name,
 induce a new variable
 record that it's an explicit key,
 add it to the task list,
 and also do the following:
 <ul>
 <li>
 If the task's value for the attribute is empty,
 and the attribute has a variable annotation,
 change the task's value for the attribute to be a reference to the induced variable.
 </li>
 <li>
 Conversely,
 if the task's value for the attribute is non-empty,
 set the induced variable's value to that value,
 and as for the empty value case,
 if the attribute has a variable annotation,
 change the task's value for the attribute to be a reference to the induced variable.
 </li>
 <li>
 Also induce rule variables for each of the attribute's rule annotations,
 recording them as explicit keys.
 </li>
 <li>
 And finally,
 if the attribute has a variable annotation,
 and the induced variable's value is a self reference that would lead to circular evaluation,
 induce a yet another variable with the induced variable's name suffixed with <code>.explicit</code>
 from the explicit annotations of the attribute,
 and also change the self-referencing variable's value to refer to that explicit variable.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
 Visit each task to handle its so called active annotations.
 Such annotations can be used on variables to compose a set of choices
 from choices defined in other variables,
 or to induce choices from the value of another variable.
 TODO examples
 </li>
 <li>
 Visit each variable task to build a key-to-value map.
 Analyze that map to determine the variable references,
 reordering the map base on this dependency analysis.
 And expand the variables in the ordered map.
 </li>
 <li>
 Expand the values of all attributes, of all tasks based on the key-to-value map, except those attributes marked as not expandable.
 E.g., the name attribute of a variable itself is not expanded.
 </li>
 <li>
 Recall that the gathering of tasks effectively <a href="Everything.html#ScopeList.footer" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">ignore</a> <a href="Everything.html#Compound" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">compound tasks</a>.
 But those compound tasks can specify <a href="Everything.html#Task.order" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">predecessors and successors</a> and well as <a href="Everything.html#Task.restrictions" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">restrictions</a>.
 As such,
 those predecessors and successors are expanded to become references to the leaf tasks.
 Furthermore,
 the resulting expanded predecessors and successors,
 as well at the restrictions,
 are propagated down to the leaf tasks.
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>

<h4><a name="FinalPhase"></a>6.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Phase</h4>
<p>
 The final phase processes a task list that is a concatenation of task lists produced from the initial phase,
 or just the one task list already processed by the initial phase.
 As such,
 it's working with task copies for which all variables have been expanded and eliminated.
 The processing for this phase augments the substitution map
 by analyzing the task list for structural duplicates.
 It then applies those substitutions,
 i.e., overriding and merging duplicate tasks,
 thereby reducing the task list before further processing.
 </p>

<h4><a name="Reorder"></a>6.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Reordering</h4>
<p>
 The processing of the task list,
 particularly task <a href="Everything.html#Task.override" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">overriding</a> and merging,
 affects the overall order of the task list such that it's different from the original authored order gathered from the scopes.
 Not only that,
 when multiple streams are involved,
 <a href="Everything.html#FinalPhase" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">final phase</a> processing is dealing with a concatenated list in which the tasks must be properly reordered.
 To support that,
 each task has an intrinsic <a href="Everything.html#Task.order" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">priority</a>;
 the task list is primarily sorted according to that priority.
 Each task also specifies <a href="Everything.html#Task.order" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">predecessors and successors</a>;
 the task list is secondarily sorted to respect that induced partial order.
 After these two sorting steps,
 the tasks in the list are modified to clear both the predecessors and successors
 and then the predecessors are set to form a chain that induces an overall order that's exactly this final order of sorted task list;
 this chain excludes variables.
 This chain of dependencies ensures that the final phase processing,
 which deals with the concatenated task lists,
 will properly interleave the tasks (because of the priority sorting)
 while also respecting the per-stream order of the multiple streams.
 <p>

<h4><a name="Filter"></a>6.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Trigger Filtering</h4>
<p>
 Each task that <a href="Everything.html#Task.excludedTriggers" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">excludes</a> the current <a href="Everything.html#Trigger" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">trigger</a> is removed from the task list.
 Note that the task list gathering process gathers <b>all</b> tasks
 because the task list is analyzed to determine which tasks need to be installed for all possible triggers.
 So for <a href="Everything.html#Trigger.bootstrap" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">bootstrap bootstrap </a>trigger,
 even the tasks that can't execute until they're running in an installed product are analyzed to ensure that,
 once the product is installed,
 the tasks that will need to perform in that installation,
 i.e., for <a href="Everything.html#Trigger.startup" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">startup</a> or <a href="Everything.html#Trigger.manual" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">manual</a> trigger,
 are properly installed.
 The processing of all tasks also implies that at bootstrap time,
 all  variables that will be needed in the running installed product will be <a href="Everything.html#PromptPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">prompted</a> early
 and hence will already be available in the running installed product.
 </p>

<h4><a name="Consolidation"></a>6.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidation</h4>
<p>
 The final task list processing step
 removes all variables from the task list
 and <a href="Everything.html#Task.consolidate" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">consolidates</a> each remaining task.
 At this point,
 the tasks in the list are ready to be <a href="Everything.html#TaskExecution" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">performed</a>.
 </p>

<h2><a name="VariableRecording"></a>7&nbsp;&nbsp;Variable Recording</h2>
<p>
 </p>

<h2><a name="TaskExecution"></a>8&nbsp;&nbsp;Task Execution</h2>
<p>
 The <a href="Everything.html#TaskComposition" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">gathered</a> task list is prepared to <a href="Everything.html#Task.performance" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">perform</a> the specified tasks.
 This list is presented to the user on the setup wizard's <a href="Everything.html#ConfirmationPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">confirmation page</a>.
 Initially,
 each task in the list is visited
 to determine if it needs to perform.
 That determination is generally influenced by the <a href="Everything.html#Trigger" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">trigger</a>.
 Tasks that don't need to perform are logically removed from the list
 to induce the so called needed task list.
 The confirmation page allows the user to see either the full list or the needed task list.

 Each task remaining in the reduced list of needed tasks
 is then performed.
 </p>

<h2><a name="SetupWizard"></a>9&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup Wizards</h2>
<p>
 Oomph provides three wizards to drive the automated installation and provisioning process.
 These wizards reuse the same underlying pages.
 They makes heavy use of Internet-hosted <a href="Everything.html#SetupResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">resources</a>,
 but these resources are cached locally on each download,
 so once cached,
 the wizards can function offline based on these cached instances.
 </p>

<a name="SetupWizard.wizardFooter">
<p>
 All the wizard's footers contain the following:
 <ul>
 <li>
 A <em>help</em> button
 to bring up this help.
 </li>
 <li>
 The usual wizard navigation buttons for back, next, finish, and cancel.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </p>

<h3><a name="InstallerWizard"></a>9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Installer Wizard</h3>
<p>
 The installer wizard is the basis for Oomph's bootstrap-<a href="Everything.html#Trigger" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">triggered</a>, automated installation and provisioning process.
 The following downloads are available for this Eclipse RCP application.
 <ul>
 <li>
 <a rel="nofollow" href="http://download.eclipse.org/oomph/products/org.eclipse.oomph.setup.installer.product-win32.win32.x86_64.zip">Windows 64 bit</a>

 </li>
 </ul>
 This download can be "installed" just like <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/Installation">Eclipse itself</a>.
 </p>

<a name="InstallerWizard.wizardFooter">
<p>
 In addition to <a href="Everything.html#SetupWizard.wizardFooter" title="Section in Oomph Setup Documentation">usual</a> controls,
 installer's footer contains the following:
 <ul>
 <li>
 A <em>network proxy settings</em> button
 to bring up the equivalent of Eclipse's <em>Window->Preferences...->General->Network Connections</em> preferences.
 Configuration the network proxies is a necessary first step for users working in an environment behind a fire wall,
 none of Oomph's Internet-hosed resources will be accessible without that configuration.
 Note that all the configured network settings will be propagated to the installed product.
 </li>
 <li>
 An <em>SSH2 settings</em> button
 to bring up the equivalent of Eclipse's <em>Window->Preferences...->General->Network Connections->SSH2</em> preferences.
 Confirming the SSH2 settings during initial installation is a good idea when using any technologies that are based on SSH access,
 i.e., if you plan to clone Git projects via public-key encryption.
 Note that all the configured SSH2 settings will be propagated to the installed product.
 </li>
 <li>
 An <em>self update</em> button
 to update the installer itself to the last Internet-hosted version.
 The wizard always check whether updates are available.
 If so, the button is animated, otherwise it's disabled.
 </li>
 <li>
 A <em>build identifier</em> so you know which version you're currently using and can provide that information for problem reports.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </p>

<h3><a name="ProjectWizard"></a>9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Import Wizard</h3>
<p>
 The project wizard is the basis for Oomph's manually-<a href="Everything.html#Trigger" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">triggered</a>, updates to the automated installation and provisioning process.
 It is available in any running Eclipse product with Oomph installed
 via the <em>File->Import...->Oomph->Projects into Workspace</em>
 and the <em>execution</em> tool bar button.
 It's purpose is to augment the <a href="Everything.html#WorkspaceResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">workspace</a>'s set of <a href="Everything.html#Stream" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">streams</a>.
 </p>

<h3><a name="ExecutionWizard"></a>9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Execution Wizard</h3>
<p>
 The execution wizard is the basis for Oomph's manually-<a href="Everything.html#Trigger" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">triggered</a>, automated installation and provisioning process.
 It's also used for startup-triggered, installation and provisioning,
 i.e., when the Eclipse product starts
 and the <em>Window->Preferences...->Oomph->Setup->Skip automatic task execution at startup time</em> preference permits,
 tasks are <a href="Everything.html#TaskComposition" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">gathered</a>,
 and if any tasks <a href="Everything.html#TaskExecution" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">need to perform</a>,
 the execution wizard is opened on the <a href="Everything.html#ConfirmationPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">confirmation page</a>.
 </p>

<h3><a name="ProductPage"></a>9.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Product Page</h3>
<p>
 The primary purpose of the product page is to create an <a href="Everything.html#InstallationResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">installation</a>
 with a specific <a href="Everything.html#Version" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">product version</a>.
 Its secondary purpose is to manage Oomph's <a href="Everything.html#BundlePool" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">bundle pools</a>.
 The product page is used exclusively by the <a href="Everything.html#Installation" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">installation wizard</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 The tree viewer of the page displays the <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/CatalogSelection.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>selected</code></a> <a href="Everything.html#ProductCatalog" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">product catalogs</a>.
 The <em>product catalog selection</em> tool bar button
 is used to choose which of the product catalogs available in the <a href="Everything.html#Index" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">index</a> are displayed.
 The <em>filter text</em> can be used to filter which of the <a href="Everything.html#Product" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">products</a> are displayed.
 The <em>collapse button</em> can be used to collapse the tree;
 initially it's fully expanded.
 The <em>refresh</em> button can be used to update the locally-cached versions of all the <a href="Everything.html#SetupResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">resources</a> used in the wizard.
 </p>
 <p>
 Selecting a specific product displays its ID, name, and version.
 The <em>Product Version</em> drop-down determines which specific version of the available product versions to install.
 The <a href="Everything.html#CatalogSelectionResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">selected product</a> is remembered,
 as well as the selected version of that product,
 so when the wizard comes up the next time,
 these will be the defaults initially available.
 Double-clicking a product automatically advances the <a href="Everything.html#ProjectPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project page</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 The <em>Bundle Pool</em> check-box determines whether the installation will use <a href="Everything.html#BundlePool" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">bundle pools</a>,
 and the adjacent drop-down determines which specific bundle pool to use.
 The <em>Manage Bundle Pools</em> button brings up the <a href="Everything.html#BundlePoolManager" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">bundle pool management</a> dialog.
 </p>

<h3><a name="ProjectPage"></a>9.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Page</h3>
<p>
 The primary purpose of the project page is to create (or update) a <a href="Everything.html#WorkspaceResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">workspace</a>
 with one or more specific <a href="Everything.html#Stream" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project streams</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 The tree viewer of the page displays the <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/oomph/setup/CatalogSelection.html" title="Interface in org.eclipse.oomph.setup"><code>selected</code></a> <a href="Everything.html#ProjectCatalog" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project catalogs</a>.
 The <em>project catalog selection</em> tool bar button
 is used to choose which of the project catalogs available in the <a href="Everything.html#Index" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">index</a> are displayed.
 The <em>filter text</em> can be used to filter which of the <a href="Everything.html#Project" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">projects</a> are displayed.
 The <em>collapse button</em> can be used to collapse the tree;
 initially it's expanded to the second level.
 The <em>refresh</em> button can be used to update the locally-cached versions of all the <a href="Everything.html#SetupResource" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">resources</a> used in the wizard.
 TODO need buttons to add and remove user projects and explain how they work
 </p>
 <p>
 Choosing a specific project displays it in the table viewer.
 There are two ways add a project to the table viewer:
 <ul>
 <li>
 Double-clicking the project.
 </li>
 <li>
 Selecting one or more projects
 and then clicking  the <em>down arrow</em>.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </p>
 </p>
 Selecting streams is optional, except in <a href="Everything.html#ProjectWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project import wizard</a>.
 In the <a href="Everything.html#InstallerWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">installer wizard</a>,
 the <em>Skip project selection</em> check-box can be used enabled advancement to the <a href="Everything.html#PromptPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">prompt page</a>
 without selecting any project streams.
 This is useful for installing a product without workspace provisioning.
 <p>
 The table viewer determines which stream of the project will be provisioned.
 The cell editor of the <em>Stream</em> column selects which specific stream of the project's available streams to provision.
 There are two ways remove a project from the table viewer:
 <ul>
 <li>
 Double-clicking the project.
 </li>
 <li>
 Selecting one or more projects
 and then clicking the <em>up arrow</em>.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </p>

<h3><a name="PromptPage"></a>9.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Prompt Page</h3>
<p>
 The primary purpose of the prompt page is to specify the values for <a href="Everything.html#Variable" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">variables</a>.
 At this point in the wizard's work flow,
 a task list has been <a href="Everything.html#TaskComposition" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">gathered</a>.
 That process induces variables and evaluates and expands variables.
 Any variable with an empty value requires the user's input.
 Information related to those variables is displayed on this page in a three column format:
 <ul>
 <li>
 A <em>label</em> column displaying the label for the variable
 with hover help that describes the purpose of the variable.
 </li>
 <li>
 A field of some sort for specifying the value.
 In the case of a drop-down field,
 the hover help displays the corresponding label of the selected choice.
 </li>
 <li>
 An optional action button to help specify the value.
 </li>
 </ul>
 The values of the variables are <a href="Everything.html#VariableRecording" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">recorded</a>.
 The <em>Show all variables</em> check-box determines whether or not those already-recorded variables
 are displayed on the page.
 All variables must specify a non-empty value in order to advance to the <a href="Everything.html#ConfirmationPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">confirmation page</a>.
 </p>

<h3><a name="ConfirmationPage"></a>9.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirmation</h3>
<p>
 The primary purpose of the confirmation page is to review that <a href="Everything.html#TaskComposition" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">gathered</a> task list.
 </p>
 <p>
 The left check-box tree viewer of the page displays the <a href="Everything.html#Trigger" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">trigger</a>
 with all the triggered tasks as children.
 The <em>Show all triggered tasks</em> check-button determines whether
 all triggered tasks are displayed
 or only the triggered tasks that need to be performed are displayed.
 Tasks that aren't needed will be grayed-out.
 Using the tree's check-boxes,
 the tasks that will actually be performed can be selectively enabled and disabled.
 A task can be double-clicked to enable only that one task.
 </p>
 <p>
 The top right tree viewer displays the nested elements of the selected task in the left check-box tree viewer.
 Similarly,
 The bottom right table viewer displays the properties of
 either the selected task in the left check-box tree viewer,
 or the selected nested element in the top right tree viewer.
 These viewers are useful for understanding exactly what the task will do when it's performed.
 </p>
 </p>
 Before proceeding the the <a href="Everything.html#ProgressPage" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">progress page</a>,
 it's important to specify the setting that affect how the tasks will be performed.
 The <em>Offline</em> check-button determines whether Internet-hosted resources will be used
 or whether execution will proceed to the best extent possible using already-cached resources.
 The <em>Mirror</em> check-button determines whether Internet-hosted resource mirrors will be used
 or whether execution will proceed using the primary Internet host.
 These settings are particularly relevant for <a href="Everything.html#P2" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">p2</a> and <a href="Everything.html#Targlet" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">targlet</a> tasks
 which make heavy use of p2 update sites.
 If the progress page detects that the tasks will overwrite an existing product installation,
 the <em>Overwrite</em> check-box will be displayed,
 and the user must confirm that they do indeed wish to reinstall, i.e., overwrite, an existing installation.
 </p>

<h3><a name="ProgressPage"></a>9.8&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress Page</h3>
<p>
 The primary purpose of the progress page is to manage the tasks while they are <a href="Everything.html#TaskExecution" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">performing</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 The tree viewer of the page displays the tasks being performed
 and the text viewer of the page displays a progress log.
 The task currently being performed is automatically selected in the tree viewer.
 While tasks are executing,
 the bottom of the page displays a progress monitor.
 The cancel button of that monitor can be used to interrupt task execution.
 The text viewer automatically scrolls to the button, unless the <em>Scroll lock</em> check-box is enabled.
 Scrolling the text viewer manually will automatically enable the scroll lock.
 Selecting an already-performed task in the tree viewer
 will select the text viewer's text associated with that tasks monitored progress.
 Once task execution terminates,
 either because it has been completed successfully, has been partially successful but requires a restart, has terminated in failure, or has been canceled,
 the progress monitor will be hidden.
 The page banner provides important feedback with regard to the actions to be taken upon task execution termination.
 The <em>Dismiss automatically</em> check-box,
 when checked,
 will result in the automatic dismissal of the dialog when task execution terminates successfully.
 The <em>Launch automatically</em> check-box, which is only available in the <a href="Everything.html#InstallerWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">installer wizard</a>,
 when checked,
 will result in the installed product being automatically launched when the wizard completes.
 The <em>Restart automatically</em> check-box, which is only available in the <a href="Everything.html#ProjectWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">project wizard</a> and the <a href="Everything.html#ExecutionWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">execution wizard</a>,
 when checked,
 will result in the installed product being automatically restarted when task execution terminates with partially successful results that require a restart,
 i.e., because the product's 'ini' file has been modified or new software has been installed.
 The restarted product will automatically open the <a href="Everything.html#ExecutionWizard" title="Chapter in Oomph Setup Documentation">execution wizard</a>,
 proceeding directly to the progress page,
 to continue performing the remaining tasks.
