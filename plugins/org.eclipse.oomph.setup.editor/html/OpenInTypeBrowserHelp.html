<h1>Open Type in Browser</h1>

<p>
  This dialogs shows a tree outline of all Java packages and classes available in the Git repository index.
  By default this index contains all Java packages and classes of each Git repository of every Eclipse-hosted project.
  The filter field can be used to easily find specific classes or packages.
  For example, entering "<tt>org.eclipse.jdt.ui.</tt>" will filter the top view to show only packages and classes whose qualified name contains "<tt>org.eclipse.jdt.ui.</tt>".
  Similarly, entering "<tt>.JavaCore </tt>", note the space at the end, will filter the view to show only packages and classes with exactly the name "<tt>JavaCore</tt>".
  The labels of items in the view are styled to show the matching characters in bold.
</p>

<p>
  The search is generally case sensitive and similar to JDT's Open Type dialog, camel-case search is supported.
  Entering "<tt>EPackage</tt>" will find all classes with this camel-case pattern.
  The special characters <tt>*</tt>, and <tt>?</tt> match one or more characters or exactly one character, respectively.
  A space at the start of the text will force the pattern to start matching at the start of the qualified name.
  Similarly, a space at the end of the text will force the pattern to match up to the end of the qualified name.
  A space in the middle of the text can be used to disable the camel-case matching behavior,
  e.g., entering "<tt>.E Package </tt>" will match all classed with exactly the name "<tt>EPackage</tt>"
</p>

<p>
The hover text of the top view shows the fully qualified name of the package or class; this is what the filter actually searches.
If there exists an Oomph Project setup for the corresponding Git clone, the item label will be decorated with the name of that setup and the hover text will include a link to it.
Clicking that link will open the Eclipse Importer with the corresponding Project setup selected.
This allows you to clone the Git repository and to import its projects into your workspace.
Double clicking a package item will expand it to its first contained class.
</p>

<p>
Selecting an item in the top view will populate the bottom view with links to web pages for browsing the selected package or class.
In the bottom view, the selected item of the top view is displayed as the root, with its fully qualified name.
Below that are one or more links to the web page for browsing the root of an available Git repository.
Below each of these are one or more links for browsing the specific selected package or class.
As in the top view, if there exists an Oomph Project setup, the item is decorated with the name of that setup.
</p>

<p>
The bottom view can be used to navigate to a web page, and, in the case that an Oomph Project setup exists, to open the Eclipse Importer.
Furthermore, if the item is for a Java class, the item can be used to open the Java editor.
This can be accomplished using the context menu, which includes the following menu items:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Copy</em> will copy the link to the system clip board.
</li>
<li>
<em>Open in External Browser</em> will open the link in your configured external browser.
</li>
<li>
<em>Open in Editor</em> will open the link in an editor using the internal browser, if available.
</li>
<li>
<em>Open in View</em> will open the link in a view using the internal browser, if available.
</li>
<li>
<em>Open in Java Editor</em> will open the link's contents in the Java editor. This is present only for Java classes and then only if the repository browser supports plain/raw links.
</li>
<li>
<em>Open in Import Projects Wizard</em> will open the Eclipse Importer with the specified Project selected; this is only available if there exists a corresponding Oomph Project setup.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The most recent "open" action used from the context menu is saved as a preference.
Double clicking an item in the bottom view will open it using this preferred style.
Similarly, selecting an item and pressing OK will also open the link using this preferred style.
</p>

<p>
Note that this dialog is non-modal so it can be kept open for longer term browsing.
Also note that the dialog can be docked on top of a view or editor in the Eclipse window.
If you drag the title area of the dialog and hover with the mouse exactly over top of the tab of a view or editor,
the mouse cursor will change, and releasing the mouse will cause the dialog to be fitted to be exactly in the area bounds of the view or editor.
The dialog will remain docked and will resize to fit the view or editor boundary when the main window is moved or resized, and even when changing perspectives.
To unlock it, simply drag it away from the docking site.
